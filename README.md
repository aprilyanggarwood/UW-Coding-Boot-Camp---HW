# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

This homework practice is to refactor existing code with **semantic** _HTML_ elements to make that webpage to be **accessible and recognized** by web browsers.

When I worked on this practice, I replaced unmeaningful `<div>` elements to **semantic** _HTML_ elements by following **a logical** _HTML_ **structure** in order to make this webpage **optimized** for search engines. The solution is rendered with the same format and content by incorporating refactoring to the _CSS_ styling codes.

## Summary of refactoring an existing webpage

- **Semantic** _HTML_ elements are used throughout the _HTML_ file.
- Comments are well described before each change in the _HTML_ file.
- The codes are refactored and edited in _CSS_ file are **clean structured** and **well functioned**, and fall in **sequential order**.
- Title is changed to a concise and meaningful title in order to precisely and clearly render the title of the webpage.
